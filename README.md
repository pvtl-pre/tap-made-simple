# Tanzu Application Platform Made Simple

This repo has scripts to deploy Tanzu Application Platform 1.4 to Azure.

## Goals and Audience

This repo is for Tanzu field team members to see how various components of Tanzu Application Platform come together to build a modern application platform. We will highlight the developer experience improvements with an eye towards operator control of the software supply chain. This could be delivered as a presentation and demo or it could be extended to include having the audience actually deploy the full solution on their own Azure subscription.

## Setup Tanzu Application Platform GUI catalog

Tanzu Application Platform GUI Blank Catalog from the Tanzu Application section of [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-application-platform/).
To install, navigate to Tanzu Network. Under the list of available files to download, there is a folder titled tap-gui-catalogs-latest. Inside that folder is a compressed archive titled Tanzu Application Platform GUI Blank Catalog. You must extract that catalog to the preceding Git repository of choice. This serves as the configuration location for your Organizationâ€™s Catalog inside Tanzu Application Platform GUI.

Example: https://github.com/pvtl-pre/tap-catalogs

## Required CLIs and plugin-ins

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [jq v1.6+](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) (to install use `brew` for Mac and `apt-get` for Linux)
- [pivnet](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivnet-cli)
- [yq v4.12+](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) (to install use `brew` for Mac and `apt-get` for Linux)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (to install use `brew` for Mac and `apt-get` for Linux)

NOTE: The Tanzu CLI and associated plugins will be installed as part of the deployment process.

## Setup Environment Variable for params.yaml

Set the PARAMS_YAML environment variable to the path of your `params.yaml` file. If you followed the recommendation, the value would be `local-config/params.yaml`, however you may choose otherwise. A sample `REDACTED-params.yaml` file is included in this directory, named REDACTED-params.yaml. It is recommended you copy this file and rename it to params.yaml and place it in the `local-config/` directory, and then start making your adjustments. `local-config/` is included in the `.gitignore` so your version won't be included in an any future commits you have to the repo.

```bash
# Update the the path from the default if you have a different params.yaml file name or location.
export PARAMS_YAML=local-config/params.yaml
```

Ensure that your copy of `params.yaml` indicates your Jumpbox OS: OSX or Linux

## Configure the Azure CLI

Ensure the `az` CLI is installed and configured. The deploy all script will use `az` to deploy an Azure Container Registry and Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.

## Configure the Pivnet CLI

Log into VMware Tanzu Network via the pivnet CLI.

```bash
pivnet login --api-token='MY-API-TOKEN'
```

## (Optional) Register Catalog Entities

Static configuration of catalog entities can be done by configuring your copy of `params.yaml` to include locations. Example, yet functional, locations are shown below.

```yaml
tap_gui:
  catalog:
    locations:
      - type: url
        target: https://github.com/pvtl-pre/tap-catalogs/blob/main/yelb-catalog/catalog-info.yaml
      - type: url
        target: https://github.com/pvtl-pre/tanzu-java-web-app/blob/main/catalog/catalog-info.yaml
      - type: url
        target: https://github.com/pvtl-pre/python-function/blob/main/catalog/catalog-info.yaml
```

## (Optional) GitHub Authentication

In order to use GitHub to authenticate, a GitHub [OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) will need to be created. The `Homepage URL` would be your TAP GUI FQDN (e.g. https://tap-gui.subdomain.example.com). The `Authorization callback URL` would be https://tap-gui.subdomain.example.com/api/auth/github/handler/frame. Once created, a Client ID and Client Secret will need to be generated.

Configure your copy of `params.yaml` to include the additional `environment` and `providers` sections.

```yaml
tap_gui:
  auth:
    allowGuestAccess: true
    environment: development
    providers:
      github:
        development:
          clientId: CLIENT-ID
          clientSecret: CLIENT-SECRET
```

## Execute the Deploy All Script

Now you can execute the following script to perform all of those tasks:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-all.sh
```

### A Record Examples

The output of the deploy-all script will prompt for A record creation for the view cluster and each run cluster.

```shell
##############################################################################
To proceed, you must register the View Cluster Wildcard DNS record with the following details:

Domain Name: *.subdomain.example.com
IP Address: 240.1.1.1
##############################################################################

##############################################################################
To proceed, you must register Iterate Cluster Wildcard DNS record with the following details:

Domain Name: *.subdomain.example.com
IP Address: 240.1.1.2
##############################################################################

##############################################################################
To proceed, you must register Run Cluster 'run-cluster-name' Wildcard DNS record with the following details:

Domain Name: *.subdomain.example.com
IP Address: 240.1.1.3
##############################################################################
```

## Tear Down

Execute the following script to tear down your environment.

```bash
./scripts/delete-all.sh
```
